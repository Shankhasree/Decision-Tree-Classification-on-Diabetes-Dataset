# Decision-Tree-Classification-on-Diabetes-Dataset
It shows how to build and optimize Decision Tree Classifier of "Diabetes dataset" using Python Scikit-learn package.
Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm. The given problem is a classification problem. The data set consists of various predictors and a target variable - Outcome. Objective is to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic.

After performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Decision Tree classicfication model run on the given dataset.
